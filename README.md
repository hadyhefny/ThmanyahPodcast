ThmanyahPodcast is a project to showcase development skills in developing Android apps.

This project is written using *Kotlin* and following *Model-view-viewModel (MVVM)* architecture pattern that follows *separation of concerns*
principle by keeping android classes as lean as possible and following Google architecture guidelines and best practices. Also by applying *Clean Architecture*
to ensure testable, maintainable and scalable systems.

The following technologies are used:

- ViewModel to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
- Dagger-hilt library to do dependency injection and reducing the boilerplate code.
- Kotlin coroutines for doing work on the background thread and communicating to the main thread.
- Jetpack Compose to simplify and accelerates UI development on Android by writing less code. It makes building Android UI faster and easier.
- Retrofit library used to provide easy way to make api requests.
